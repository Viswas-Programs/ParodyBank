# ParodyBank

This is a parody of a bank account program, usually seen with real banking websites. 
this tries to imitate them, with a purely python program, with importing shelves, which's built into python.
this can also be real if the destination of the input values are changed, from shelves to real servers, if doable.

Feel free to contribute to the project and make a good PR about it. (although I am not a good at making good pr's but whatever...)
